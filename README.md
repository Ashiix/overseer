# overseer
### An open-source and self-hosted multipurpose Discord bot
<br>

## Install
overseer relies on a couple of libraries to function, all of which can be installed using pip.
- discord.py
- sqlitedict

## Configuration
overseer comes mostly ready to launch immediately, but there are a few settings you need to tweak for it to function correctly, all of which can be found in config.py

## Running
overseer is written in Python, meaning no compilation is needed. once you have the requires libraries, and have completed configuration, simply run main.py
